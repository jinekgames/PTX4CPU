# Emulator which lets you run CUDA code on x86 CPU

**Current project state**: prototype implementation

**Project TODO:** [TODO.md](./TODO.md)


## What it will do?

Core functionality of the project is running of the CUDA PTX assemble code on the x86-based systems.
Using this you'll be able to run applications made for CUDA on platforms without CUDA support (platforms which do not include Nvidia GPU on board)

## How it works

The solution is to get compiled PTX code (which is generated by the nvcc) and emulate it to be ran on the CPU. The emulation consists of parsing of the PTX code and interpritating it on the runtime.

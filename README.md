# Emulator which lets you run CUDA code on x86 CPU

**Current project state**: prototype implementation

**Project TODO:** [TODO.md](./TODO.md)


## What it will do?

Core functionality of the project is translation from CUDA PTX assemble code to x86 copatible asseble code.
Using this you'll be able to run applications made for CUDA on platforms without CUDA support (platforms which do not include Nvidia GPU on board)

## How it works

The solution is to get compiled PTX code (which is generated by nvcc) and translate it to x86 asemble code. Including host C++ sources code, we'll be able to recompile the application using translated sources for the target platform.
